The future scope of this prediction is by integrating it with other time-based forecasting models. This integration aims to enhance the time period of the forecast from a single point or day to multiple sequential points in time. By combining the strengths of various forecasting models, the expanded system will offer a more comprehensive and accurate prediction of future trends and patterns.

### Benefits of Integration

- **Extended Time Period**: Integrating this prediction model with other forecasting models will enable forecasts for multiple sequential points in time. This allows users to gain insights into expected trends and fluctuations across various time intervals, providing a more detailed understanding of future outcomes.

- **Informed Decision-Making**: By expanding the time period of the forecast, decision-makers can make more informed and proactive choices. They will have a better grasp of how trends unfold over extended periods, enabling them to plan and allocate resources accordingly.

- **Enhanced Accuracy**: The integration of multiple forecasting models brings together their respective strengths, improving the overall accuracy and reliability of the predictions. By considering a broader time horizon, potential inflection points, seasonal variations, and cyclical patterns can be identified more effectively.

<!-- ## Conclusion

The integration of this prediction model with other time-based forecasting models expands its scope and capabilities. It allows for forecasts spanning multiple sequential points in time, leading to more informed decision-making, enhanced accuracy, and improved planning across various industries. This integration opens up new avenues for research, analysis, and proactive decision-making. -->
