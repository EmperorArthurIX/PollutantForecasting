#### Concept

Air pollution, particularly `Particulate Matter`, poses a significant threat to human health and the environment. Accurate prediction of air quality is crucial for effective pollution management and the implementation of timely mitigation strategies. This research project aims to predict the concentration of `PM10` (particulate matter with a diameter of `10 micrometers` or less) by utilizing multiple air pollutants, including `PM2.5`, `NO2`, `CO`, and other relevant chemical species, as predictors.

#### Factors

The study leverages a comprehensive dataset consisting of historical measurements of `PM10`, `PM2.5`, `NO2`, `CO`, and various other air pollutants. These pollutants have been widely recognized as major contributors to air pollution, and their concentrations are routinely monitored in urban areas. By using multiple air pollutants as predictors, we can capture the complex interactions and synergistic effects among different pollutants, thereby enhancing the accuracy of `PM10` prediction.
