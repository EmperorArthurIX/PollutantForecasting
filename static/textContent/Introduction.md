#### Overview of the Problem

Air pollution is a pressing environmental issue that poses substantial risks to human health and the ecosystem. `Particulate Matter (PM)`, specifically `PM10` (particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less), has been identified as a significant contributor to air pollution-related health problems. To effectively manage and mitigate the impact of air pollution, accurate prediction of PM10 concentrations is vital. This research project aims to develop prediction models for `PM10` by utilizing multiple air pollutants and meteorological factors, wherever befitting, including `PM2.5`, `NO2`, and `CO`, as predictors.

#### Proposal

The selection of multiple air pollutants as predictors is based on their known association with air pollution and their routine monitoring in urban areas. By incorporating various pollutants as predictors, the complex interactions and synergistic effects among them can be captured, leading to improved accuracy in `PM10` prediction. To achieve this, `machine learning` techniques, specifically `Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)`, `Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)`, and `Extra Trees Ensemble Regression`, are employed.

The use of `LSTM` and `BiLSTM` models allows for the capture of `temporal dependencies` and long-term patterns present in the air quality data. These models are well-suited to handle time series data, making them effective in predicting `PM10` trends. Additionally, the `Extra Trees Regression` algorithm, which combines multiple decision tree regressors, may also be used to get an accurate `prediction` given a set of known predictors.

#### Technique

The research project involves several stages, starting with data preprocessing, including data cleaning, handling missing values, and normalizing the pollutant concentrations. Feature selection techniques, such as correlation analysis and importance ranking, are employed to determine the most influential air pollutants in predicting `PM10`.

#### Metrics

The trained machine learning models are evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics, including `mean squared error (MSE)`, `root mean squared error (RMSE)`, and `coefficient of determination (R-squared)`. The performance of these models is compared to determine the most accurate and reliable approach for `PM10` prediction.
